@javiereguiluz I just rebased this PR and made it green. So it's ready for you to try out locally whenever you want :) (no pressure at all, things won't break)

Wouter, thanks a lot for this great work. What a nice addition to the PHP highlighting ðŸ™‡ðŸ™‡

I've been playing with it locally and it works exactly as expected:

* It improves many edge cases that previously weren't highlighted...
* ... without breaking any of the existing highlighting

A before/after example using one of the same examples that you showed:

So, we can totally merge this and start using it in production. Thanks!
