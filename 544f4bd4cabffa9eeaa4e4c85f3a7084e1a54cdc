Antoine, thanks for updating the implementation of this PR.

I've reviewed it and it looks great to me 👍

I only have a question ... I don't remember the details, but in symfony.com we build Symfony Docs and other docs different from Symfony (Cloud docs, bundles docs, etc.). So, what would happen if we use `{version}` in those docs? Do we have in this docs-builder app the concept of doc "version" instead of or in addition to "Symfony version"? Thanks!

Version is set with `BuildConfig`. I think each docs have specific value ?

https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/blob/43325d00d96ad51af2f90b61cb43e47b5918f450/_build/build.php#L22-L23

Maybe I have to rename `{version}` to `{symfonyVersion}` ?

Or introduce substitution config in BuildConfig, but I think it's overkill for now

No ... my question was exactly about that ... if `{version}` is always "the version of the doc being rendered" ... that's perfect because this feature would work for ALL docs, and not ONLY for Symfony Docs.

It's always value of `->setSymfonyVersion()` setter

And that makes sense, the other docs should use absolute URLS.

@alamirault can you please rename the the PR title accordingly? I think it does not match the current PR content anymore
