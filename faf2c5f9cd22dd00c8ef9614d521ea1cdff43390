Pretty cool and it works nicely in any chromium based browser.

I'm a bit sad that it doesn't work for Firefox yet ([although they are positive](https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/#scroll-to-text-fragment)), but given the current anchors also don't work I'm :+1: to use an anchor that at least work for a part of the userbase.
